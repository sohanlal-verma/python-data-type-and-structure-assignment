# Python Theory and Practical Assignment

This repository contains my Python assignment, which I completed as part of my coursework. The assignment includes both **theory questions** and **practical coding exercises** implemented in Python. The notebook was created using **Google Colab**.

## Assignment Overview

This assignment is divided into two sections:

### Theory Questions
This section includes conceptual questions about Python programming language and its data structures.

### Practical Questions
The practical section consists of coding tasks designed to demonstrate Python concepts such as lists, dictionaries, sets, strings, tuples, and more.

## Theory Questions

1. **What are data structures, and why are they important?**
2. **Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.**
3. **What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?**
4. **Describe how dictionaries store data.**
5. **Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?**
6. **What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?**
7. **How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?**
8. **What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?**
9. **Can lists contain different data types in Python?**
10. **Explain why strings are immutable in Python.**
11. **What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?**
12. **How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?**
13. **Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.**
14. **How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?**
15. **Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.**
16. **What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?**
17. **Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.**
18. **In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?**
19. **Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?**
20. **Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**

4. **Convert the string "hello" to uppercase.**
5. **Replace the word "apple" with "orange" in the string "I like apple".**
6. **Create a list with numbers 1 to 5 and print it.**
7. **Append 10 to the list [1, 2, 3, 4].**
8. **Remove 3 from the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].**
9. **Access the second element in the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].**
10. **Reverse the list [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].**
11. **Create a tuple with the elements 100, 200, 300 and print it.**
12. **Access the second-to-last element of the tuple ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow').**
13. **Find the minimum number in the tuple (10, 20, 5, 15).**
14. **Find the index of the element "cat" in the tuple ('dog', 'cat', 'rabbit').**
15. **Create a tuple containing three different fruits and check if "kiwi" is in it.**
16. **Create a set with the elements 'a', 'b', 'c' and print it.**
17. **Clear all elements from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.**

19. **Find the union of two sets {1, 2, 3} and {3, 4, 5}.**
20. **Find the intersection of two sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4}.**
21. **Create a dictionary with the keys "name", "age", and "city", and print it.**
22. **Add a new key-value pair "country": "USA" to the dictionary {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}.**
23. **Access the value associated with the key "name" in the dictionary {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}.**
24. **Remove the key "age" from the dictionary {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 22, 'city': 'New York'}.**
25. **Check if the key "city" exists in the dictionary {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'Paris'}.**
26. **Create a list, a tuple, and a dictionary, and print them all.**
27. **Create a list of 5 random numbers between 1 and 100, sort it in ascending order, and print it.**
28. **Create a list with strings and print the element at the third index.**
29. **Combine two dictionaries into one and print the result.**
30. **Convert a list of strings into a set.**
